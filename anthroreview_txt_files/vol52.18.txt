Language and Race: Settler Colonial Consequences and Epistemic Disruptions\
Linguistic anthropology cannot be decolonized. Or can it? While ways of seeing, hearing, recording, analyzing, writing, publishing, reading, and citing have undoubtedly transformed since Franz Boas (1911) established the anthropological study of language, the field of linguistic anthropology remains bound by the consequences of empire and White supremacy that initially enabled it. Enduring colonial ideologies and institutions, along with Boas's \'93salvage anthropology,\'94 which separated race and language, have enshrined White racism in anthropological studies of language as well as among linguistic anthropologists.\

This article reviews major anthropological paradigms that link the study of language and race. It focuses on the United States as an exemplar of a settler colonial nation that continues to use language as a tool of racialization to bolster White supremacy. Furthering Boas's concept of linguistic relativity, decades of studies analyzed power and inequality with attention to gender, class, and ethnicity, but not race. Ethnographic research on the consequences of settler colonial linguistic racialization was first conducted by Latinx (Zentella 1997) and White women (Hill 1998, Urciuoli 1996). The gender imbalance of this epistemological labor is hardly coincidental; rather, it mirrors the White patriarchal structures of academia, those of colonialism itself.}
