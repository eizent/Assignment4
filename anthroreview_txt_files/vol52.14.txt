 A Linguistic Anthropology of Images\
A linguistic anthropology of images doesn't exist. This statement is true in that images have not served as a central object of concerted theoretical explication for linguistic anthropology for most of its history (as, e.g., language, interaction, and ideology have). The statement, however, is false in at least three ways. First, linguistic anthropologists have long analyzed images of various sorts (photographs, films, etc.), even if they have not always theorized the image as such. Second, some recent research in the field has topicalized the image as object for theorization (as I review in what follows). But most importantly, this statement is falsified once we realize that linguistic anthropology has developed an account of images\'97sans la lettre and avant l'image, as it were\'97in its analysis of the pragmatic poetics of discourse. In this review, I work through these three falsifications to spell out and paint a picture of what a linguistic anthropology of images might be, with a particular focus on leveraging the third (the account of the image in discourse, that is, discourse as image) to add to the second (theorizing the image as such).}
