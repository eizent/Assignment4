Inspiring Continuities
In her provocative Perspective article, Ruth Tringham reflects on the people and processes that shaped and shifted her rich and multifaceted research trajectory. These "triggers of inspiration," as Tringham christens them, influenced her early path to the Neolithic of Eastern Europe with its initial focus on the clues that flaked stone assemblages could provide into changing prehistoric subsistence patterns. They also introduced her to the ethnographic and historical frameworks of anthropology, which brought both nuance and depth to a more traditional archaeological analysis of culture change. Her research continued to be inspired by people and events during the disruptive period from 1988 to 1993, when political changes were reconfiguring Eastern Europe. During this same period, feminist critiques of archaeology were also taking off, sparking new ways of looking at old questions and data. The infusion of gender considerations into archaeological analyses provided new dimensions in which Tringham could en- rich her signature small-scale approach of household analyses with the life histories of their individual occupants. This disruptive period also coincided with revolutionary advances in digital technology, which Tringham embraced from the outset. She was quick to recognize the "power of its multimodal and multimedia complex navigational structures," which she harnessed for interpreting both the processes by which archaeologists reconstruct prehistory and alternative scenarios that can be created. Tringham's "archaeology with the senses" and juxtaposition of "imagined narratives with empirical data" are amplified by the reviews encompassed in the two themes, Multimodality and Security/Insecurity, that weave through this volume. Indeed, traces of Tringham's appreciation for the "humanistic way of using scientific data" can be found across the critical reviews representing all subfields of anthropology.
