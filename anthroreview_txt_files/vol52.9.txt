Biological Normalcy\
Examining and contesting ideas about what is \'93normal\'94 is a core concern for anthropologists, who describe human population variability and try to understand it within its local context and from a comparative perspective. In doing so, anthropologists challenge judgments about diverse ways of being, which include assumptions or assertions about what is normal human behavior or biology, and thereby provide more inclusive views of what it means to be human. The term normal is used in widely varying discourses beyond anthropology and has meanings that encompass the descriptive (statistical) and the evaluative (normative). When applied to human biology, these dual meanings are particularly evident in biomedicine, where normal is equated with healthy. However, embedded in the term healthy are biases about what is normal that come out of particular cultural and historical contexts. Here I review the ways that normal is understood and used in anthropological and related studies of human biology and biological variation and propose a framework for understanding how the two meanings of normal inform each other and their consequences for human biology.\

This review has three interrelated aims. One is to examine uses of the term normal in anthropology and related fields, with a focus on how it is applied to the study of human biology and biological variation. The second is to develop the analytic framework of biological normalcy to identify relationships between the statistical/descriptive and evaluative/normative meanings of the term normal. The third is to provide some illustrative examples.}
