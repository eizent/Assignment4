Steps to an Ecology of Algorithms\
Here is a definition of algorithms: Algorithms are standardized ways of satisfying if-then conditionals, often working with Boolean binary values and running on electric circuits, operating autonomously, depending on varying degrees of freedom. Such a definition is of little help to social scientists or to anyone else for that matter. What does it mean to say that algorithms do things? What should anthropology, and social science more broadly, want from, and in, the study of algorithms? And what does it even mean to study algorithms? This review draws together a number of literatures to outline one possible answer to the question of how to study algorithms. That answer is that we should study algorithmic ecologies.\

Algorithms have been studied as organizers of attention and addiction (Kockelman 2013, Seaver 2019), as shapers of taste and objects of care and capture (Seaver 2022), and as shapers of publics (Gillespie 2014, Crawford 2016). They have been considered as self-learning drivers of automation (Lowrie 2018) and as powerful fetishes (Thomas et al. 2018). Algorithms have been argued to reorganize modern rationality and vision (Erickson et al. 2013, Halpern 2014, Totaro & Ninno 2014). Studies have focused, among other things, on music improvisation labs (Wilf 2013), music recommender companies (Seaver 2017), precision warfare (Suchman 2020), dating website companies (Illouz 2013), search engines (Gillespie 2014), marketing and web analytic companies (Cheney-Lippold 2011), plagiarism software (Introna 2016), works of art (de Vries & Schinkel 2019), and Netflix (Hallinan & Striphas 2016). Programmatic texts have appeared, pointing the way forward for anthropological studies of algorithms (Dourish 2016; Seaver 2017, 2018), and there is now even an Annual Review of Anthropology article.}
