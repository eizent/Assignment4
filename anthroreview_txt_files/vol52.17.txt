 Social Movements, Power, and Mediated Visibility\
Smartphones and their inherent visuality have come to consume more of our daily lives since they were introduced as a mass consumer product in the late 2000s. As the underlying technology has become cheaper, their reach has become global (Geismar & Knox 2021). The subsequent popularization of social media and texting platforms has impacted the quotidian rhythms of how we live, interact, and communicate. We are inundated with media on multiple platforms, and their speedy and seemingly ubiquitous circulation impact how we organize ourselves, demand change, rebel, and are, in turn, surveilled, manipulated, and drawn into larger media wars.1 In this article, I discuss current research in anthropology and related fields on the intersections of these topics and point to potential areas for further research for ethnographers in this fast-paced, ever-changing terrain.\

This article was initially supposed to be about visual media and social movements. But using prevailing anthropological approaches to studying media, including applying a critical lens to the ways in which visuality is incorporated within larger \'93media worlds\'94 of production, circulation, and consumption (Ginsburg et al. 2002), it became imperative to bring in the study of hegemonic power to understand more critically the struggles of our times and what social movements are up against in order to become visible in the crowded media environment predominated by social media. At the heart of this article is a discussion not of visual media per se, but rather of how social movements attempt to become visible in today's (screen-saturated) media environment, how those in power seek to make these movements less visible, and what this struggle portends for today's politics.}
