 Human Bodies in Extreme Environments\
Human habitation of extreme environments is a long-standing area of interest within biological anthropology and human biology, and with good reason because humans have successfully inhabited every continent on this planet. Humans in extreme environments offer the opportunity to document evidence of multiple levels of adaptation from genetic to functional. We have come a long way over more than a century and gained a better understanding of human biological flexibility, phenotypically and genetically, in the face of extreme environments in terms of both adaptation and acclimatization, though there is still a great deal more to learn.\

Unfortunately, there is a pressing need now more than ever to improve our understanding of how human bodies survive and thrive in extreme environments. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its sobering sixth assessment report, which unequivocally states that human activity is driving global climate change (IPCC 2021). Human-induced climate change has resulted in increasingly variable and extreme weather events across the globe. Just within the United States in 2021, the state of Texas experienced an uncharacteristic ice storm, the Pacific Northwest grappled with extreme heat and extensive wildfires, and hurricanes flooded parts of the South and Northeast coasts. Globally, the 2022 men's World Cup in Qatar experienced unseasonably high temperatures and humidity, and in December 2022, the Horn of Africa was experiencing its worst drought in decades, devastating people through severe hunger, malnutrition, and dehydration.}
