 Making a Difference: The Political Life of Religious Conversion\
Ostensibly, religious conversion is about making change in one's life. Across the range of disciplinary engagements with the topic of religious conversion (anthropology included), the notion of change has set both the terms and the clusters of questions around which scholarly discussion on the subject has evolved. The nature of change indexed by this concept varies greatly. Conversion is sometimes described in dramatic terms, such as \'93transformation,\'94 \'93departure,\'94 \'93break,\'94 and \'93ruptures\'94 (Meyer 1998, Thangaraj 2015), and sometimes in more benign terms such as \'93reorganization\'94 or \'93passages\'94 (Austin-Broos 2003, Frigerio 2007). It is framed as either a radical turning point\'97a complete break with the previous self (Beckford 1978); a gradual, partial, and fluid change (Lacar 2001, van Nieuwkerk 2006, Reidhead & Reidhead 2003); an exploratory engagement (e.g., Kraft 2017)\'97or an ongoing labor and aspiration, a steady quality of religious experience (Coleman 2003). Conversion can be forced, can be an outcome of capitulation, can be sought out voluntarily, or can be situated in a complex structure-agency configuration (Kravel-Tovi 2012, 2019; Smilde 2007; van der Veer 2006). It can be perceived by converts as a nonissue (Meintel 2007), conducted offhandedly, or solemnized by way of formal ritual (Kravel-Tovi 2017, pp. 192\'96202; Wimberley et al. 1975). The change entailed can be described as a \'93paradigmatic change\'94 (Jones 1978), \'93a change in the universe of discourse\'94 (Travisano 1970), a \'93change of heart\'94 (Heirich 1977), or a \'93change of identity\'94 (Sachs-Norris 2003), to mention only a few of the terms of choice. These multiple and important varieties notwithstanding, the common point of departure is that conversion occasions a significant change, often with a definite direction and destination.\

Ultimately, the interdisciplinary field of conversion studies has been highly engaged with\'97and, at times, haunted by\'97the attempt to define itself by assessing the quality, pace, and scope of changes that warrant the rubric of conversion (e.g., Meintel 2007, Rambo 1993, Travisano 1970). When anthropologists entered the field, they questioned the coherence and strength of religious conversion as an analytic category (Asad 1993, p. 47; Chua 2012; Comaroff & Comaroff 1991, pp. 249\'9658; Roberts 2016). Specifically, scholars have critically observed that the notion of a significant personal change provides a thin and simplified umbrella, imposing the existence of a false conceptual unity on what is, undoubtedly, a highly variable phenomenon within and beyond the Western world. After all, in both indigenous and scholarly discourses, religious conversion denotes an extensive array of changes. It denotes not only the adoption of another religion, but also mass spiritual effervescence, religious awakenings, rebirth, boundary crossings between religious affiliations within the same religion, and trajectories of repentance. Equally important, the concept of religious conversion has been criticized for generating a reified, supposedly universal and stable understanding of religion and religious faith (Comaroff & Comaroff 1991, p. 251), while also masking the Western, modern, and Christian ideological biases of these analytic constructions (Asad 1996, pp. 265\'9666).}
