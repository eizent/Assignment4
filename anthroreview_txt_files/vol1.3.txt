Studies of Modern Man\
This review of studies in the physical anthropology of modern man concerns papers that have appeared in the period from mid-1969 to mid-1971. Though far from comprehensive it aims to show how much activity there is in each major topic of investigation in the biological study of populations of man that exist today, and to pick out any trends in investigation that may be detectable. Several topics have been intentionally excluded, e.g. behavior studies, psychometric investigations, descriptive osteometry, and epidemiological works relating to particular disease states.}
