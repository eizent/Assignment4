Archaeological Settlement Patterns\
This paper reviews published material concerned with the analysis of pat- tern in the physical remains of human settlement. Although my major concern is with prehistoric settlement, I have also tried to deal with studies which focus on physical traces of occupation, whatever their status with respect to historical documentation. I have made no attempt to discuss the literature on settlement of industrialized societies at the nation-state level, nor have I tried to incorporate the abundant literature from locational geography, plant ecology, or animal ecology where techniques and methods have been developed which have a definite, although largely untapped, potential for new analytical approaches to archaeological settlement. Because I have focused on studies whose explicit purpose has been the description and analysis of settlement patterns, I have made no effort to discuss the vast literature ethnographical, archaeological, and historical which contains data of potential utility to settiement pattern studies. In this review I trace the historical development of the settlement pattern concept in archaeology; define the principal concerns and issues which investigators have considered to be important; discuss something of the substantive results of settlement pattern study through a sampling of representative published materials; and provide an assessment of the major accomplishments and future needs of settlement pattern analysis in archaeology. DEVELOPMENT OF CONCEPT AND METHODOLOGY From the English-language literature it is apparent that the study of ancient settlement has developed through two largely independent traditions: one in America and the other in England. The American tradition finds its most immediate roots in Morgan's last published work (67), which originally appeared in 1881. Here Morgan posed the critical question of how the re- mains of aboriginal residential architecture in North America reflected the social organization of the prehistoric peoples who occupied them.}
