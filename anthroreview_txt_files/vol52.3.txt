Recent Developments in the Archaeology of Long-Distance Connections Across the Ancient Indian Ocean\
Reviewing material connections across the ancient Indian Ocean in a brief review is a daunting task. The ancient Indian Ocean is spatially and temporally vast, embracing a dizzying array of communities with their own histories and motivations, occupying littoral tracts that border hinterlands with their own desirable resources and commodities, all traversing complex maritime environments. Building the evidentiary database requires the coordinated efforts of multiple specialties, including but not limited to history, archaeology, epigraphy, numismatics, maritime technology, and materials science. The resulting maelstrom of scholarship (particularly in the last two decades) can, for both experts and nonspecialists, obscure important developments concerning this geographic space, and may in part explain why there has been limited anthropological engagement with this material.\

This review seeks instead to offer a broad synthesis, enabling the reader to appreciate the chronological and geographic scope of research and introducing multiple points of entry for those wishing to delve deeper. Its scope is thus deliberately delimited. First, as a review of the archaeology of the Indian Ocean (Supplemental Figure 1), I foreground fresh contributions about material connectivities, minimizing a historiography that stretches deep into the previous century and has been reviewed countless times. Second, I focus on sites (primarily ports, transshipment points, settlements, and mortuary sites) with archaeologically visible nonlocal materials. Not surprisingly, these are generally ceramic, stone, glass, and metal artifacts; the many perishable trade goods are represented mostly by shipping and storage containers. Third, while there exists abundant archaeological research on material links between communities within subregions of the Indian Ocean, here I emphasize material traces of the long-distance maritime-based movement of cultural elements (objects, people, ideas, etc.) between the subregions.}
