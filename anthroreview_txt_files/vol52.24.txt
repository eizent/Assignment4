Security Regimes: Transnational and Imperial Entanglements\
Security regimes are increasingly an object of interest and a vital subfield of political anthropology. Alongside scholars in geography, international relations, cultural studies, ethnic and race studies, and gender studies, anthropologists have been critically studying the frame of security, approaching it as a logic and relation of power. In a global order dominated by discourses of risk and threat, the ability to shape subjects and govern through public fears has paved the way for expansive and intrusive modes of surveillance, policing, militarized borders, and endless wars.\

This article reviews key theoretical and methodological contributions that anthropologists have made to the study of what we call security regimes. While on the one hand the growing preoccupation with security and terrorism has resulted in the expansion of state power (Chalfin 2010, Rana 2011, Masco 2014, Ali 2019, Rizvi 2019), the state is increasingly only one among a range of actors invested in and acting in the name of security (Goldstein 2010, Maguire et al. 2014, Grewal 2017, Diphoorn & Grassiani 2019). We define security regimes as the multilayered ensemble of actors, institutions, discourses, and relations that have manifold effects and exert control over individuals, families, populations, and nations in the name of security. This definition allows us to focus on the study of the state as well as the actors, sites, and relations often considered to be beyond the state. It includes, but is not limited to, the domination of military institutions and technologies over social life.}
