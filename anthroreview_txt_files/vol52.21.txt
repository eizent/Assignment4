Remarking the Unmarked: An Anthropology of Masculinity Redux\
In 1997, when the first review article addressing issues of men and masculinities and men as men appeared in the Annual Review of Anthropology (Gutmann 1997), it was evident that the subject was understudied. In the following years, hundreds of books and articles appeared in what some have called the \'93ethnographic moment\'94 in men and masculinities studies overall (Connell & Messerschmidt 2005). These studies accomplished in part a filling-in-the-blanks and offered refutations of previous self-satisfied views that as often as not were based on personal experiences and opinions more than on actual research and grounded analysis. And, as always, the best work also helped to refute racist and postcolonial stereotypes, for instance, ethnographies of masculinities in predominantly Muslim countries, which confronted Islamophobia in various guises around the world (see Atshan 2020, Boellstorff 2005, Ewing 2008, Ghannam 2013, Inhorn 2012, Moussawi 2020, Naguib 2015, Peletz 2021).\

This profusion of ethnographies has proved valuable in documenting and conceptualizing men and masculinities around the world and through history, thus marking these previously taken-for-granted categories. This new article aims to survey the state-of-the-art studies of men and masculinities in anthropology and ethnography from other disciplines; the emphasis here is on cultural anthropology, but reference is also needed to biological (for example, Bribiescas 2005; Fuentes 2012, 2021), linguistic (for example, Lawson 2020), and archaeological anthropology (for example, Tung 2021, Voss 2008), where important work since 2000 has been done on men, masculinities, violence, sexuality, and similar subjects. Similarly, most citations are to English-language texts, but a small selection of indispensable work in other languages is mentioned. This review addresses the main topical areas in the anthropology of men and masculinities, theoretical frameworks used by and debates among anthropologists and other scholars working on relevant topics, anthropology's main impact in the field more widely, what has changed since the 1990s, and what new challenges this area of study may tackle in the future.}
