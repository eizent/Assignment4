The Great Pirah\'e3 Brouhaha: Linguistic Diversity and Cognitive Universality\
Few disputes in academia have been as colorful or bombastic as the brouhaha surrounding the 2005 paper that Daniel Everett published in Current Anthropology, challenging theories of universal grammar and proclaiming the power of culture to constrain and shape cognitive faculties (Everett 2005, pp. 621, 634). Working with the Pirah\'e3, a group of about 300 native people living in the Amazon basin of Brazil, Everett claimed to have found one of the simplest language systems yet documented.\
\
Pirah\'e3, Everett reported, has no numbers or concept of counting; no fixed terms for colors; no perfect tense; no tradition of art or drawing; no creation myths or fiction; no individual or collective memory deeper than two generations; the simplest kinship system known; and, after more than 200 years of regular contact with Brazilian settlers, no ability to communicate in any language other than Pirah\'e3. Everett (2005) attributed this \'93surprising simplicity\'94 to a cultural principle he called the \'93immediacy of experience,\'94 in which speakers are limited to referencing only present-time, concrete experience (p. 621).\
\
The most truculent of Everett's claims, however, is his contention that Pirah\'e3 syntax displays no evidence of recursive embedding\'97the capacity of sentences to refer back to themselves indefinitely. The point is consequential because recursion is said by universal grammarians (hereafter, universalists) to be the only design feature of language that is unique to humans and present in all human languages (Hauser et al. 2002, p. 1569). Everett believed that his findings would have the power to undermine that theory. In his 2005 article, he threw down the gauntlet, spurring a debate that would continue for nearly two decades. Linguists from several disciplinary backgrounds entered the fray, including linguistic anthropologists.}
