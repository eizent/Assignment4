Global Health Interventions: The Military, the Magic Bullet, the Deterministic Model\'97and Intervention Otherwise\
One popular account of global health describes the field as a \'93collection of problems\'94 that solidified at the start of the twenty-first century, in which a group of people\'97mostly white men, mostly from the so-called Global North\'97adopted an approach to health intervention that supplanted the twentieth-century field known as international health (Farmer 2013; see also Brown et al. 2006). In this account, global health comprises a coalition of philanthropic, governmental, nongovernmental, corporate, clinical, and university experts charged with confronting medical pathologies and threats to biosecurity. Packard (2016) writes in his history of the field that \'93global health\'94 has been constituted as a series of \'93interventions into the lives of other peoples.\'94\

This history reflects the establishment of global health institutions and the production of global health knowledge and expertise. One study finds that more than 85% of the organizations active in global health or global health policy are headquartered in Europe or North America, and more than 80% of the leaders of global health organizations are nationals of high-income countries, with women holding less than 5% of leadership roles (Davies et al. 2019; Glob. Health 50/50 2020, pp. 17, 26, 30; van Daalen et al. 2020). Racism within global health institutions compounds gender, geographic, and class disparities (B\'fcy\'fcm et al. 2020, Yam et al. 2021). Bhakuni & Abimbola (2021) find that even within the academic field of global health, authorship practices, research partnerships, publishing choices, research questions asked, and methods used, \'93are peppered with epistemic wrongs that lead to or exacerbate epistemic injustice\'94 (p. e1465). Reflecting on how poorly the United States and United Kingdom handled the outbreak of COVID-19, Dalglish (2020) argues that \'93the pandemic has given the lie to the notion that [global health] expertise is concentrated in, or at least best channeled by, legacy powers and historically rich states\'94 (p. 1189; see also Manderson et al. 2021).}
