 Social Strategies and Social Relationships\
A shifting emphasis from concern with social or cultural rules to an interest in adaptive strategies of human aggregates has become increasingly evi- dent in anthropology during the past 20 years. The general theoretical basis for such work seems to lie in multilinear evolutionary theory, especially as set forth by Steward (135, 136), and discussed as "specific evolution" by Sahlins & Service (123). The fundamental problem to which such theory pertains is simply how to conceive of continuity and change within a unified frame of reference. In social anthropology there are several milestones, such as the conceptual frameworks of Firth (47) and L\'e9vi-Strauss (92) and the ethnographies of Leach (86) and Barth (11). Alland (2) has made a major effort to consider evolutionary processes and ongoing adaptation of human aggregates within a unified scheme, which unfortunately omits most of the productive social anthropological studies. Among other things, this review seeks to redress such omission. The analysis of social strategies is emerging as the core of adaptational ' The actual review was undertaken under the auspices of National Science Foundation Grant No. GS-2999 as part of the conceptual refinement necessary to understand differential ethnicity as adaptive strategies in the face of national develop- ment policies in "third world" nations. The authors are convinced that a comprehensive review of this subject could encompass virtually all of the social and behavioral sciences. Where possible we have referred the reader to existing reviews of relevant literature of many crucial approaches touched on here, such as "adaptational theory," "game theory," "conflict theory," "exchange theory," "social change." We wish to thank Paul Ballanoff for his aid in framing the review and for contributing a number of productive ideas. All faults in commission, omission, and judgment are, of course, our own.}
