Critical University Studies\
\
The 2020s have been marked by events of great significance to everyday people as well as national and international institutions, including the global lockdown and financial impacts of COVID-19, the resurgence of Black Lives Matter movements around the world following the murder of George Floyd, an attack on the US Capitol by right-wing extremists and the continuing rise of right-wing populism in many parts of Europe, and US military withdrawal from Afghanistan after more than 20 years, to name just a few. What is the relationship of institutions of higher education to such events and actions? As we were completing this piece, we were following the largest strike of university workers in US history, at all the University of California (UC) campuses, which followed on the heels of a graduate student worker cost-of-living strike in the UC system in 2020. What is the relationship between these strikes and the broader events of the last three years? How do academic labor, study, and knowledge production impact other institutions, such as militaries, states, stock markets, and media, and how are they in turn impacted? In this article, we explore the field that has come to be known as critical university studies (CUS), an interdisciplinary body of scholarship that begins to answer these questions.\

Favoring an expansive definition of CUS, we draw from scholars who trace the historical origins of the American university system to the slave trade, racial science, and Native American ethnic cleansing projects (Adams 1995; Stein 2016, 2022; Wilder 2013), as well as scholars who bring abolitionist and decolonial stances to highlight how the university not only is foundationally violent and exclusionary, but continues to perpetuate state interests, carceral and settler logics, empire, and antiblackness in its everyday practices as well as through its knowledge production (Chatterjee & Maira 2014, Ferguson 2012, Grande 2018, Harney & Moten 2013, Trouillot 2003). Many of these approaches come out of anti-imperialist, anticapitalist, and feminist activist movements spearheaded by student activists on college campuses (see, for example, AUIP Editor. Collect. 2010, Ferguson 2017, Libcom 2009).}
