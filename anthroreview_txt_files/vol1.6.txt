 Demographic Studies in Anthropology\
A common definition of the field of biological anthropology is that it concerns the description, causes, and consequences of variability in human bio- logical characteristics. As such it is somewhat surprising that so little attention has been devoted to such an important biological parameter as human demography. In the early development of anthropology there was a brief interest in demography as attempts were made to discover whether some men had found a way to increase longevity. These myths persist with reports of great age in the USSR and the South American Andean region. Anthropologists were also curious about the longevity of our ancestors so that both historical and skeletal studies of mortality were in vogue. At the opposite end of the life cycle considerable effort was expended on the study of sex ratios at birth and the nature of seasonality in birth. Despite these early interests the fie Id of demography was not pursued with any depth until recently. At the moment interest in demographic data is very much on the rise and shows no sign of being near its peak. The reasons for the increased inter- est can be catalogued into three discrete developments of the 1960s. First, the development of extensive research programs on the nonhuman primate in his natural environment has produced a new body of descriptive data. Second, the development of human population genetics from the general synthetic theory of evolution has indicated the need for new types of demo graphic data on nonwestern populations. Finally, the strong interest in a subject area best called human ecology has suggested new ways in which we can understand the immediate causes and effects of population differences in demographic characteristics. In this paper we will attempt to highlight the current status of research in these topics even though much of the subject matter has been}
