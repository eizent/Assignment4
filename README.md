## Exploration of Change Over Time Within the Annual Review of Anthropology

This repository contains a corpus of text samples from the articles published in first issue of the Annual Review of Anthropology (1972) and from the most recent issue from 2023.
The text was manually scraped by me from https://www.annualreviews.org/journal/anthro. The text samples from the first issue were taken from the preview page of the article (the first page) using the 'copy text in image' feature. However, the articles
published in the 2023 journal were available online, and the text sample comes from copying the first two paragraphs of the introduction section. The length of the texts for each entry
is about equal because the preview page typically also displays the first 2-3 paragraphs of the article. I believe that for the scope of this analysis, this amount of text will be enough
to generate a general understand of the semantic styles and thematic differences that might appear. 

# Intended use
This repository, dataset, and any subsequent analysis may be of interest to those in the field of anthropology who are interested in seeing the development of the field-- especially in regards to language used.
